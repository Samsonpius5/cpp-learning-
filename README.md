# C++ Learning Journey 🚀

This repository documents my journey learning **C++** and core programming concepts.

I’m focusing on building a strong foundation through practice, small programs, and problem-solving.

## What I’m Learning
- Variables and data types
- Input and output
- Conditions (if / else)
- Loops (for, while)
- Functions
- Arrays
- Pointers
- Basic problem solving

## Structure
Each folder contains simple C++ programs related to a specific topic.
